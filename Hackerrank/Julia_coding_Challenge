Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

Input Format

The following tables contain challenge data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker. 

Challenges: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, and hacker_id is the id of the student who created the challenge.

SOLUTION: 



WITH tbl_num_challenges as (
    
SELECT      H.hacker_id,
            H.name,
            COUNT(C.challenge_id) as num_challenges
FROM        Hackers H
JOIN        Challenges C ON C.hacker_id =H.hacker_id
GROUP BY    H.hacker_id, H.name
-- ORDER BY    num_challenges desc 
-- We cannot use order by clause in Contemporary Table(WITH)
)

,tbl_count_challenges as (
select      num_challenges,
            count(num_challenges) as count_challenges
FROM        tbl_num_challenges
GROUP BY    num_challenges
--order by    tot_challenges desc
)

SELECT      tnc.hacker_id,
            tnc.name,
            tnc.num_challenges
FROM        tbl_num_challenges tnc
JOIN        tbl_count_challenges  tcc on tcc.num_challenges = tnc.num_challenges  
WHERE       tcc.count_challenges <=1
            OR
            tnc.num_challenges = (SELECT max(num_challenges) FROM tbl_num_challenges)

ORDER BY    tnc.num_challenges desc,tnc.hacker_id;
